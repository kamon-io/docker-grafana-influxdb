docker-grafana-influxdb
=======================

This image contains a sensible default configuration of InfluxDB and Grafana. It explicitly doesn't bundle an example dashboard.

### Using the Dashboard ###

Once your container is running all you need to do is open your browser pointing to the host/port you just published and play with the dashboard at your wish. We hope that you have a lot of fun with this image and that it serves it's purpose of making your life easier.

### Building the image yourself ###

The Dockerfile and supporting configuration files are available in this Github repository. This comes specially handy if you want to change any of the InfluxDB or Grafana settings, or simply if you want to know how the image was built.
The repo also has `build`, `start` and `stop` scripts to make your workflow more pleasant.

### Configuring the settings  ###

The container exposes the following ports by default:

- `80`: Grafana web interface.
- `8083`: InfluxDB Admin web interface.
- `8084`: InfluxDB HTTPS API (not usable by default).
- `8086`: InfluxDB HTTP API.

To start a container with your custom config: see `start` script.

To change ports, consider the following:

- `80`: edit `Dockerfile, ngingx/nginx.conf and start script`.
- `8083`: edit: `Dockerfile, influxdb/influxdb.conf and start script`.
- `8084`: edit: to be announced.
- `8086`: edit: `Dockerfile, influxdb/influxdb.conf, grafana/config.js, set_influxdb.sh and start script`.

### Running container under boot2docker on Mac OS X ###
Currently, there is an issue with boot2docker dicussed [here](https://github.com/kamon-io/docker-grafana-graphite/issues/5). To bypass this, change the last line in start script to the following to start the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8086:8086 --name grafana-influxdb_con grafana_influxdb
```

InfluxDB is configured by default with two databases. `grafana` DB for storing your Dashboard and `data` DB for storing your measurements. You can edit all default passwords in `Dockerfile`. If you wanna edit DB names, users and passwords, have a look at the following files: `grafana/config.js, set_grafana.sh, set_influxdb.sh and Dockerfile`

HTTPS API wasn't tested yet, that's why it isn't configured. Some boilerplate code can be found in `Dockerfile and set_influxdb.sh`. Needs testing and possibly more.
